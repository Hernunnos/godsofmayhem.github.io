Our hacker website

We are the Gods of Mayhem and this is where we tell you about the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/" target="_blank" name="Y Combinator">Y Combinator</a> project we submitted for Winter 2015. Now, we are looking to <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/want-to-start-a-coding-school-want-a-coding-school-in-your-hometown-check-out-hack-reactor-extensions?utm_source=master+list_segmented&utm_campaign=20459be833-Extension+Announcement_11.3.14&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3eb95f6109-20459be833-85364681" target="_blank" name="Hack Reactor Extension">bring Hack Reactor</a> here to Phoenix, AZ.

We wish to start-up a social enterprise to provide resources to teach people the basic knowledge needed to start learning how to code. Our website target audience will be women, minorities, students with HIGH student loan debt and eSports enthusiasts.  

*For example, people who have completed or have been in a degree program (i.e. game developers) who are still unable to find suitable employment.

After submitting our application we discovered and have been working to support <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" name="Free Code Camp">Free Code Camp</a> started by <a href="https://plus.google.com/109218050636199098197/posts" target="_blank" name="Quincy Larson">Quincy Larson</a>.

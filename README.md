Our hacker website

We are the Gods of Mayhem. We are looking to make you WATCH eSports.

We wish to start-up a social enterprise to provide resources to teach people the basic knowledge needed to start learning how to code with an emphasis on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2015/01/16/future-of-edtech-101-automation-curation-and-gamification/">gamification</a>. Our website target audience will be women, minorities, students with HIGH student loan debt and eSports enthusiasts.  

*For example, people who have completed or have been in a degree program (i.e. game developers) who are still unable to find suitable employment.
